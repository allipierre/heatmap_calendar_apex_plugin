#Oracle APEX Heatmap calendar plugin

Heatmap calendar is a region type plugin that shows year calendar where days are arranged into columns by week, then grouped by month and years. The values are visualised as colored cells per day. 
It is based on [Mike Bostockâ€™s Calendar View](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063318) and uses [D3 JavaScript library](https://github.com/d3/d3)
